This Application is a Sorting algorithm comparator

This zipped file contains:

1) folder named CODE which contains source code files and the EXECUTABLE file (Sorting Algorithms App.exe)
2) video explaining the project
3) Project report.pdf
4) project Report .docx
5) READMEFILE.txt obviously 

*what this application is capable of:

1) It supports 8 algorithms:

- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Quick sort
- Radix sort
- Counting Sort

2) It compares each algorithm with its time complexity (measured with steps) big-O
3) It compares various algorithms with eachother

TO RUN THE APPLICATION:

***********SIMPLY RUN THE EXECTUABLE FILE IN THE CODE FOLDER************

(IT WILL TAKE A FEW SECONDS TO RUN AFTER THE CMD OPENS)









IF THE EXECUTABLE FILE DOESNT WORK :(
                   |
                   |
                   v

*Needed resources for the application to Work:
- install python if not installed on the computer
- intall pip package manager
- run this command in the CMD:
 python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose
- An IDE (preferable Visual Studio Code)
- python extensions on VSCODE (code runner, pylance,python,mplstyle(matplotlib),jupyter)
- 7zip to extract the zipped file

NOTE:
close the figure screen eachtime you want to choose a different algorithm
